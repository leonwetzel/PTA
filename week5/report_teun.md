## 5. Pick five to ten cases randomly on this...

1. (Parks, Synset('parks.n.01'))
2. (County, Synset('county.n.02'))
3. (America, Synset('united_states.n.01'))
4. (States, Synset('state.n.06'))
5. (Ontario, Synset('ontario.n.02'))



### Are they correct?

Yes, four of them are correct as they give the correct synsets.

### Are they wrong?

The fourth pick seems wrong as 'States' indicates the US but the synset that is given indicates the word means 'state' and is not part of a country name.

## 6. Did it happen that the same word was assigned a different sense in the same Wikipedia page?

Yes, for example one time the U.S. is dexscribed as 'united_states_government.n.01' and another time as 'united_states.n.01'.

### Do you think it can depend on the extention of the context you decide to use?

Yes, when more data is available the script can make better decisions when the extended text continues on the current subject, but more data can also be misleading for the script if the text continues in another subject.



## 7. Does what you can observe from the above correspond to what you were expecting?

Yes, this is also the case for human, when there is not a lot of context.

## 8. How do you think you could use disambiguation in your Wikification project?

Disambiguation can be used to make words point to the correct database more often.
