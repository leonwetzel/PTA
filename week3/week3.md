## Exercise 2

### Part 1

To start the server, we use the following bash command:

```shell script
$ java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer
 -port 9000 -timeout 15000 -serverProperties server.properties
```

We count 2 ORGANIZATION's, 1 LOCATION and 2 PERSON's. 
Not all the shown named entities are correct. For example,
 *Augusta Ada King* and *Ada* are named as ORGANIZATION, 
 which is not correct in this particular context.
